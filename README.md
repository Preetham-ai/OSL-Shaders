## Working principe of mix node

This is pretty similar to linearly mixing any two different things with a mix factor.
For an example, in math, if we want to mix two functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, we usually do it by taking a mix factor $t$, and the output is going to be a new function $h(x) = tf(x)+(1-t)g(x)$. Here, $0\lt t\lt 1$.
